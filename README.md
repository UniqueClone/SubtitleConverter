# SubtitleConverter

A tool for converting .srt files to .vtt and vice versa.

Run the tool by downloading the file `SubtitleConverter.py` and running this command where you saved that file:

```bash
python ./SubtitleConverter.py
```

This will open a file dialog for you to select a `.srt` or a `.vtt` file. The tool will create the opposite type to your selection with the same name. For example, if you select a file called `Demo.srt`, a new file in the same location called `Demo.vtt` will be created.
